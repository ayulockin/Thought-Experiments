# Thought-Experiments
This repository will contain my thought experiments conducted in the field of Deep Learning. 

1. [Meow_and_Woof](https://github.com/ayulockin/Thought-Experiments/blob/master/Meow_and_Woof.ipynb): Uses 1D colvolution for audio classification of Cat and Dog. Achieved 83% train and 75% val on basic architecture. Nothing fancy. 

    I had this thing in my head going for sometime that 1D Conv like 2D conv can capture simplified feature in the initial layers. Like for an image classification the initial layer usually end up being an edge detector. So I thought the initial layer for 1D conv or audio classification will be some envelope like psd or hilbert or homomorphic. 

    And it turned out that it's true.
